## Introduction
RefRef is a synthetic dataset and benchmark for reconstructing scenes with refractive and reflective objects from posed images. The dataset contains 50 objects of varying complexity, each placed in three different background types, resulting in 150 scenes. We propose an oracle method for accurate light path calculation and benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the challenges of reconstructing such objects.

## Dataset
The dataset is available on Hugging Face:
